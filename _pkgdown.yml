    These functions access data from the NOAA 
    [Integrated Surface Database](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database) 
    (ISD), a global database that consists of hourly and synoptic surface 
    observations compiled from numerous sources into a single common ASCII 
    format and common data model. The ISD includes numerous parameters such as 
    wind speed and direction, wind gust, temperature, dew point, cloud data, 
    sea level pressure, altimeter setting, station pressure, present weather, 
    visibility, precipitation amounts for various time periods, snow depth, 
    and various other elements as observed by each station.
