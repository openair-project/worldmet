    These functions give access to the NOAA Global Historical Climatology 
    Network (GHCN), which includes an [hourly](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/global-historical-climatology-network-hourly),
    [daily](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily),
    and [monthly](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-monthly) 
    product, all of which can be accessed by `worldmet`. The GHCN includes many 
    useful parameters such as wind speed and direction, temperature, 
    atmospheric pressure, precipitation and snowfall.

    These functions access data from the NOAA 
    [Integrated Surface Database](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database) 
    (ISD), a global database that consists of hourly and synoptic surface 
    observations compiled from numerous sources into a single common ASCII 
    format and common data model. The ISD includes numerous parameters such as 
    wind speed and direction, wind gust, temperature, dew point, cloud data, 
    sea level pressure, altimeter setting, station pressure, present weather, 
    visibility, precipitation amounts for various time periods, snow depth, 
    and various other elements as observed by each station.
